# Testing Fréchet Means and Variances

This directory contains code implementing tests from the paper ''Fréchet Analysis of Variance for Random Objects" by Paromita Dubey and Hans-Georg Müller.

Files: 

1) Test_Hypothesis_Laplacians.R: This code takes in two arrays of graph Laplacians and determines if the Fréchet means and variances of the distributions of these groups are equal or not.  


Please reach out to me with questions or comments or improvements to the code at sl223@uw.edu!
