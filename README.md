# Testing Fréchet Means and Variances

This repository contains code that implements the tests from the paper ''Fréchet Analysis of Variance for Random Objects" by Paromita Dubey and Hans-Georg Müller.  Please reach out to me with questions or suggestions on how to improve the code at sl223@uw.edu!

1) Test_Hypothesis_Laplacians.R: This code takes in two arrays of graph Laplacians and determines if the Fréchet means and variances of the distributions of these groups are equal or not.
